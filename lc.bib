abstract = {Simple analytical forms for the orientation dependence of the potential between two molecules are derived from a Gaussian overlap model. Orientation‐dependent range and energy parameters are determined, which can be used with any two‐parameter atomic potential to give simple and reasonable polyatomic potentials.},
